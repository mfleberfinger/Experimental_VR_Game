__VR UI__

Make VR buttons that can be used by physics raycasting.


Button (write tests before writing functions):
	- A button has a default state, a hovered state, and a pressed state.
		+ Like with Unity's UI buttons, a color will be assigned to each state
			through the editor.
	- A button will have a collider attached, set as a trigger.
		+ This is used for raycasting or touching the button.
	- A button will have callback functions assigned through the editor,
		similar to Unity's buttons.
	- Methods:
		HoverStart():
			Set color to hovered color.
		HoverEnd():
			Set color to default color.
		Press():
			Call the callback functions.
	- Data:
		public UnityEvent callbacks:
			The methods to be called when the button is pressed.
		public Color defaultColor
		public Color hoveredColor
		public Image image:
			The image used to represent the button.
			
	
RayPointer (Ideally tests would be written but may be more trouble than they're worth):
	- A RayPointer is given a reference to a transform to determine where to
		raycast from and in which direction.
	- A RayPointer will raycast on FixedUpdate() and tell any button encountered
		that it is being hovered over.
		+ When a button is encountered it is saved as hoveredButton and
			hoveredButton.HoverStart() is called.
		+ On each frame in which the raycast hits something, RayPointer will
			compare hoveredButton with the hit thing. If that thing is not
			hoveredButton, hoveredButton.HoverEnd() is called. If the hit thing
			is another button, a reference is stored in hoveredButton. Otherwise,
			hoveredButton is set to null.
		+ On a frame where the raycast hits nothing, hoveredButton.HoverEnd()
			is called and hoveredButton is set to null.
	- When the click/press action occurs, the RayPointer will call the Press()
		function of the button it is raycasting to. If it is not raycasting to
		a button, it will do nothing.
	- Data:
		public VRButton hoveredButton { get; private set; }:
			The button the player is pointing at. Null if no button is pointed at.
		public Transform raycastOrigin:
			Transform from which to raycast. Transform.Forward will be used
			to set direction.
