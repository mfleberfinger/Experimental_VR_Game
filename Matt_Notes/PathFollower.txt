The path follower moves at randomly varying speed through space. The speed should
	be constant and motion should be smooth.
	- Failure to hold speed constant can result in the player catching up to
		and being able to see the end of the tunnel that their path follower is
		chasing.

Instead of getting the next location on each frame, get the next location, move
	to it at a constant speed, then get the location after that and repeat.


// TODO: SMOOTH MOVEMENT. At the moment there is a lot of stuttering/vibration.
//		using w to control speed is also reducing the resolution of the path
//		generated by the Perlin noise function. Decouple path resolution and
//		follower speed by increasing w by a constant step size and moving
//		from one point to the next at a constant speed, regardless of how
//		far apart they are.
