__Tube Generator__

As the object to which the TubeGenerator script is attached moves through space,
	segments of tube mesh are generated behind the object out to some maximum
	distance.
To avoid generating an endlessly growing mesh, each segment will be an individual
	mesh, which will be deleted some time after the player has passed through it.


The tube generator game object will follow the same path as
	the player (defined by some curve calculated based on a random seed
	and distance from the starting point, but will stay ahead of the player.
	- Calculate the center points in scene world space as follows, where
		(x, y, z) is the position in the Unity scene's world space, and
		xpx, xpy, ypx, and ypy are randomly generated at the start of
		the game and remain constant thereafter.
		x = Perlin(z + xpx, ypx) - Perlin(xpx, ypx)
		y = Perlin(z + xpy, ypy) - Perlin(xpy, ypy)

		Important: The player's speed along the path will be controlled
			(either constant or steadily increasing) by being controlled
			between the points defined by this math. The math is only
			defining the path that will be followed by the player, to
			which the tube generator will be attached.
