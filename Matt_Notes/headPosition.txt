The player's head needs to stay inside the tube when playing the game.

The player's head needs to be positioned near the center of the tube when the
	player is sitting or standing comfortably.


Possible Solutions:
	
	Initial centering:
		- Find the player's height, then move the floor offset so their head
			will be centered vertically within the tube. 
			+ Even if it is possible to get the height that the player set while
				configuring their headset, this ignores the possibility that
				more than one person uses the headset or that the player may
				want to play the game while sitting.
			+ In the case of the rift, the distance between the floor and the
				head's current position seems to be what is known.
		- At the start of the game, set the floor offset so that the player's
			head is within the tube.
			+ When Start() is called, it appears that the headset has not started
				being tracked (or at least the tracked pose driver hasn't
				updated the position of the object to which it is attached).
		- For testing, possibly add a button to re-center the head during
			gameplay. This is not viable for release because it would allow the
			player to instantly move to the center of the tunnel.
		- Provide a menu option to set the neutral/centered position to the
			player's current head position.
			+ This is probably the best choice.

	Staying Inside the Tube:
		- If the player's head is ever outside the bounds of the tube, move the
			flooroffset to put the player's head back inside (alternatively, if the
			player is only allowed to be hit once, count this as a loss and end the
			game).
